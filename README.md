# HTML Notes
* Inline n Block Elements
    * Inline elements cant have some style properties that blocks have such as height and weight. However they can be identified like block such as :
    ```
    <b style="
        display: inline-block;
        height: 50px;
        ">example</b>
    ```
* Some display types: initial, inherit, none, inline, inline-block, block, list-item, table, table-row, table-cell, flex, inline-flex

* When inspecting on browser Styles is the part what I identified for elements and Computed is what is identified automatically by browser.

* Normalize.css
