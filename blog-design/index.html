        <p>The person leading the U.S. response to the 
            <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/your-most-pressing-questions-about-the-coronavirus-answered-c99bff5f02e9">
                coronavirus outbreak
            </a> , Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
            is preparing herself and her family for a possible pandemic that could cause 
            “severe” disruption to everyday life as businesses curtail activity, schools 
            possibly close, and social gatherings are discouraged. <br>
    
            “I had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning,” Messonnier 
            said today in a conference call with reporters. “And I told my children that 
            while I didn’t think that they were at risk right now, we as a family need to be 
            preparing for significant disruption to our lives.” <br>
            
            Messonnier, who directs the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory 
            Diseases, sounded the most concerning tone yet that COVID-19, as the disease is called, 
            will likely become a pandemic. “The fact that this virus has caused illness and death, 
            along with sustained person-to-person spread is concerning,” she said. It meets two of 
            the criteria for a pandemic. Meanwhile, she said, “the world moves closer to meeting the 
            third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus.”

        <blockquote class="gray ff-sans">
            “We really want to prepare the American public for the possibility that their 
            lives will be disrupted because of this pandemic.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>That would seem to be already the case. Community spreading — cases that appear without a 
            known source of exposure — are now occurring in Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, 
            South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. <br>
    
            “Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country,” Messonnier said. 
            It’s no longer a question of if, she says, but when and how many people will become severely ill.
